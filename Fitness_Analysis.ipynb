    "Session duration and workout frequency were the strongest positive predictors, suggesting that both workout length and frequency play a critical role in energy expenditure. The data confirms that longer sessions and more consistent sessions are associated with substantially higher calorie burn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Body fat percentage showed a strong negative relationship with calories burned. Holding other variables constant, higher fat percentage was associated with lower calorie expenditure per session. This aligns with physiological principles, where individuals with leaner body compositions tend to have higher metabolic efficiency during physical activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Age also demonstrated a statistically significant negative relationship with calories burned, reflecting a gradual metabolic decline with age when other variables are controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables such as workout type and gender were tested but ignored in the final model. Once physiological variables (heart rate, duration, fat percentage) were included, these categorical features provided minimal additional explanatory value and became statistically redundant.\n",

This emphasizes the importance of focusing on workout intensity and individual fitness characteristics rather relying on broad classifications."
